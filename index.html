     <section>
       <a id="intro"></a>
       <p> Hello, my name is <strong>Chason Sande</strong> and I am attempting one of my Dreams 
       of being a Software Engineer.  I am looking forward to administering my 
       analytical mindset and quirky perspectives to help the forefront of technology
       be advanced with well intended purpose and integrity.
       </p>
       <!--A little more depth into who I am-->
       <p> I <em>reside</em> in <strong>Cleveland, Tennessee</strong> and recently opted out of owning a vehicle to instead ride
       a bicycle. Even though I may not have a car, I still happen to get around this life just fine.
       I particularly enjoy traveling to destinations in a well paced manner, taking in the scenic view
       while breathing in fresh wind.
       </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <a id="about"></a>
          <p>I am independently driven by the wonders of capability. I am often curious
            about the <em>what ifs</em> and the <em>who knows</em>. I get excited when
            something doesn't make sense, as I try and make sense of it. I listen to perspectives
           of my peers while joining in with my own to tackle problems we face.</p>
            
            <p>As a natural writer I hope my talent can be traversed into the code I create.</p>
            <p>In fact, some of the things I enjoy apart from coding are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Cryptographic Currency Trading</li>
              <li>Writing/Speaking</li>
              <li>Exercise/Exploration (Mind & Body)</li>
            </ol>
